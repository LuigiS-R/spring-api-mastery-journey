**Objective:** This repository documents my Spring Framework learning journey for the last month. It is a MVC pattern following project containing
my work-in-progress applying Spring's core concept: Dependendency Injecton. It also included the usage of basic Spring annotations necessary in the 
development of RESTful APIs such as @RestController, @PathVariable, @RequestMapping. I have also made use of ORM tools such as Hibernate to make the work
with my local database easier and more convenient.
